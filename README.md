Date: 7 Oct 2025

🎯 Objective

To gain hands-on experience in identifying and tagging key volleyball match events using the SportsVisio platform and understand the fundamentals of sports data operations.

🧠 What I Did

Attended an introductory session on volleyball gameplay and event structure.

Understood how coaches’ performance data is transformed into taggable actions.

Performed manual tagging under trainer supervision:

Serve / Serve Ace / Serve Error

Dig / Kill / Block / Reception Error / Ball Error

Used seek controls (+1s, +3s, +10s) to locate event frames accurately.

Practised player rotation mapping (on-court vs bench).

Received positive trainer feedback: “Good, let’s give other opportunities.”

💡 Key Learnings

How to connect each event to the correct player and timestamp.

Developed focus and rhythm across entire rallies.
